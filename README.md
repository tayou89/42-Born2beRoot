# Introduction
- This is one of 42 Seoul subjects.
- The purpose of this subject is setting an Linux Operating System on virtual machine.
- For this project, I chose 'Debian' as operating system and 'Virtual Box' as virtual machine.
- Unfortunately, virtual machine was not saved at git repository because of large file size.
- Only monitoring shell script remains executed by cron on Linux.
